This project allows users to login using set usernames and passwords.  Default login is username: admin / password: password
Once logged in users can create new users, providing the username does not already exist and the password reentry matches.
Users can create tasks with due dates only set from today onwards, assign task to a user and add task description.  This is then saved to a text file.
Users can view all tasks for all users (completed, uncompleted and overdue), reading from the text file of tasks.
Users can specifically view their tasks (completed, uncompleted and overdue), reading from the text file of tasks.
Users can generate reports showing number of tasks and percentages for completed, incomplete and overdue tasks as a text file and the user overview as text file.
Only the user 'admin' can generate overall statistics.
Exit menu exits the program.
The program has been written with user error/defensive programming to ensure the program does not crash if incorrect input is entered.
